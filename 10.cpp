/*  For a sorted array, which of the following algorithms will take less time ? Explain with examples.
  i)Bubble sort.
  ii)Insertion sort
 iii)Counting sort.
 */

/*
ANSWER: Insertion Sort. When the array is already sorted, insertion sort takes O(n) complexity. Bubble sort also can be a choice (With optimized redundant testing and redundant iterations). It takes O(n) complexity.
